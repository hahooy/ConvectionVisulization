Convective flow visulization
==============================
This program calculates and plots the spatial dependence of vertical flow velocity produced by horizontal temperature gradients in an infinite long cylindrical tube. The theoretical flow profile is given by the Hadley convection function. My initial intend is to use this program to aid in visulizing resistive-heating inducing thermal convection in my **electrophoretic NMR** (ENMR) experiments. The output figure is a bird-eye view of the flow profile. Red color suggests zero velocity while purple suggests highest velocity.
